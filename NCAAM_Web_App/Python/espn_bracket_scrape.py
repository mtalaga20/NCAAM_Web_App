From now until Selection Sunday on March 17, we\'ll keep you up to date on the postseason chances and projection of your favorite teams. Our brackets will update Tuesday and Friday now that teams have started conference play. We will culminate with daily updates throughout Championship Week in March, all with an eye toward the 2024 NCAA men\'s basketball tournament. Bracket WatchTop Overall SeedPurdueFirst Team OutTCULast Team InNorthwesternRarely in bracketology is a head-to-head result determinative when it comes to seeding. In this update, however, a single December contest is the dividing line for the final No. 2 seed. Clemson\'s loss at Miami opened the spot, with both Kentucky and North Carolina next in line to move up. It\'s a very close call numerically, but the Wildcats edged the Tar Heels on a neutral court last month and we\'re using that to break the evaluation "tie." It\'s Kentucky Blue that becomes a 2-seed and Carolina Blue holds as a No. 3. In the bigger picture, this Saturday the Big 12 and SEC become the final power conferences to begin league play. It is officially bracket season.On the BubbleLast Four Byes Virginia Utah State South Carolina FloridaLast Four In Texas Nebraska New Mexico NorthwesternFirst Four Out TCU St. John\'s Texas Tech CincinnatiNext Four Out Kansas St. Butler Washington Wake Forest68-Team BracketMoved UpMoved DownNew Team to BracketAutomatic Qualifier16Merrimack16New Mexico St.11Texas11Nebraska16Southern16Stetson12Northwestern12TCUMIDWEST (DETROIT)Indianapolis1 Purdue16 Merrimack - aq/ New Mexico St. - aq8 Ole Miss9 Iowa StateBrooklyn5 Baylor12 Princeton - aq4 Memphis - aq13 Weber St. - aqPittsburgh6 Alabama11 Texas/ Nebraska3 Clemson14 Akron - aqIndianapolis7 Ohio State10 Mississippi St.2 Marquette15 Colgate - aqEAST (BOSTON)Brooklyn1 UConn16 Marist - aq8 Dayton - aq9 MiamiPittsburgh5 Oklahoma12 Indiana St. - aq4 Wisconsin13 Samford - aqSalt Lake6 Creighton11 Grand Canyon - aq3 BYU14 Morehead St. - aqCharlotte7 Michigan St.10 James Madison - aq2 Tennessee - aq15 Vermont - aqSOUTH (DALLAS)Omaha1aq -  Houston16aq -  Southernaq -  Stetson/8 Nevada9 ProvidenceSpokane5 Auburn12 Northwestern TCU/4 Fla.

ESPN bracketologist Joe Lunardi uses the same data points favored by the committee, including strength of schedule and other season-long indicators, including the NET and team-sheet data similar to what is available to the NCAA, in his projections of the field. Visit the NCAA\'s website for a fuller understanding of NCAA selection criteria.68-Team BracketThe 68-team bracket is the standard version of the NCAA tournament field that has been in place since 2011. If the 2021 field is comprised of 68 teams, there will be some key differences to past years, however.The primary adjustment from a normal year is, of course, the playing of the entire NCAA tournament at a single site. This eliminates the need for geographical considerations in seeding. Additionally, there will be at least one fewer automatic qualifier this season, as the Ivy League\'s decision to forgo the 2020-21 season reduces the number of AQ entries to 31 for this season.48-Team BracketIn this projection, a condensed selection process would reduce the field by 10 at-large teams and 10 automatic qualifiers (the latter of which still receive a revenue unit). The top four seeds in each region would receive a bye into the second round, with four first-round games per region - 5 vs. 12, 6 vs. 11, 7 vs. 10 and 8 vs. 9 - being played without fans on the higher seed\'s home court.To minimize travel, first-round pairings will be guided by geography to the greatest extent possible. And the reduced field results in only 32 teams competing at the central site. All participants must post a minimum .500 conference record - the "Lunardi Rule" - for at-large consideration.16-Team BracketIn this projection, the committee selects and seeds the 16 best available teams. There are no automatic qualifiers, although all non-competing conference champions receive the designated revenue unit.To maintain some sense of national balance, conference participation is capped at four teams. And no region shall have more than one team from the same conference.\nMore Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren\'s Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact UsDisney Ad Sales SiteWork for ESPNCorrections\nCopyright: Â® ESPN Enterprises, Inc.
